### Hi there I'm Arkanius (Victor Gazotti)

> Engineering Leader, Full Stack Architect & Serial Maker.

With 10+ years of experience, I combine the strategic vision of a **former CTO** with the hands-on execution of a **Senior Full Stack Engineer**. I specialize in leading teams and building high-performance, end-to-end systems using the **Laravel ecosystem**.

#### What I'm Building Now
I love the **Build in Public** ethos. Currently, I'm solving real-time communication challenges:
* **[Ressonance](https://ressonance.com):** A robust **Websocket-as-a-Service** platform for developers who need scale without the headache.

#### ⚡ Key Achievements
* **Async PHP Runtimes:** Cited in the official Swoole book; former maintainer of `laravel-swoole`.
* **Full Stack Mastery:** Deep expertise in building modern, reactive SPAs using **Vue.js**, **Inertia**, and **TailwindCSS**.
* **Scale:** Managed millions of monthly active users (MAU) with lean teams, driving product strategy while maintaining high system availability and performance.
* **Leadership:** Proven track record of hiring, mentoring, and leading engineering squads.
